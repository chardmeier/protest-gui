THINGS TO DO:

Before annotation starts:
* [DONE] Make warning messages for conflicting annotations more specific
* [DONE - some layout issues] Amend browser window to contain a list of classes, each with three buttons (new,done,conflicts)
* [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add a field in the pro_examples table to contain a sequence number (used to define the order in which pronoun examples are presented to the annotators)
* [DONE: yellow->orange; aqua->dodgerblue] Change the highlight of selected tokens (yellow->orange; blue->green)
* [DONE] Add simple instructions to the top of the annotation window
* [DONE] Add instruction to the guidelines that if the pronoun is present in the translation output but is not highlighted (i.e. a bad alignment) to leave a comment in the remarks box
* Include a case where the source-language pronoun is not aligned to anything in the translation output - change the question in the annotation panel to reflect that the decision is as to whether an untranslated pronoun is correct/incorrect
* Add a “bad translation” field to the annotations table + provide annotator with a button to mark a translation as “bad”
* [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add an annotators table which stores the ID (int, key) and name (string)
 	- [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add an annotator “ID” field to the annotations and token_annotations tables
* Write import / export functions in SQL (import annotations into master DB / export annotator DB out of master DB - to contain only what the annotator needs to do their annotation work)
* Provide a means to check the context of an annotator DB - corpus name, annotator, date, number of examples etc.
	- [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Construct a meta_data table with two fields: tag (string), value (string)
	- [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add entry to capture: file_type: master DB / annotator DB
	- [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add entry to capture: masterID: “DiscoMT2015”
* Provide a means for annotator task assignment (back-end)
	- [DONE: AddToDatabase.sql] Add a tasks table to the database - this will map example IDs to annotators

Any time:
* Create one complete database create statement, with original table definitions plus additions listed above?
* Create an external CSS file with which to control annotation highlight colour scheme/ presentation
* Provide a method to remove all arteries related to a given system, from the database
* Remove A3-108 system from the manual annotation task as output is so poor
* Provide a means for annotator task assignment (front-end). Provide a method to randomise the order of the examples, and calculate overlap for IAA
* Provide a means to view inter-annotator agreement: re-purpose the main annotation window to allow the user to toggle between two or more annotators’ annotations of the same example
* Provide script to compute IAA
* [SQL script written: RemoveApproval.sql] Remove the "approval" flags and table from the SQL database and evaluation script
* Re-write automatic evaluation script in some other language? For LREC and for inclusion in the GUI - can this be written in the same code?
